### Virtual NIT Hamirpur
RollonHills is an initiative to amalgamate creativity and technology. The sole purpose of the game is to seek contributions from students of NITH (outsiders are more than welcomed). For Tech Nazis, the game uses unity as a platform and C# as the scripting mode. For people who have a hand in art, we have used blender to render 3D models. Each and every building of NITH has been designed in blender approximating the height map. 

Till now it is a free-mode game having a character that can control different vehicles and can access different areas of the campus and do many amazing things.

A project that incorporates a 320(nearly) acre campus has infinite possibilities. Our vision was to kick-start the project through the hackathon and let it grow through contributions. 

We have also taken in cnsideration the future goals. Since there are no limitations, any person can push any mission in the game; also future incorporation of Machine Learning and AI cannot be denied. The NITH campus can be toured virtually; 3D view obviously gives a better picture. 

All ideas are welcomed that can contribute even an iota to this NITH project.
